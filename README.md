### 1. Installing dependencies

Once we have the code one our local machine, we then need to make sure we have all of the dependencies we need!

1. Install

``` bash
yarn
```

2. Spin up the development server

``` bash
yarn dev
```

Alternatively,  we can easily run both of these using this command.

``` bash
yarn && yarn dev
```
